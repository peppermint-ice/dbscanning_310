# dbscanning_310

Here's the project with the code that I'm using for DB scanning.
db_clusterization.py is a lib with the functions that I wrote to ease implementation
analyzing_the_plys.py is a playground which I use to extract the information that I need to configure the workflow
main.py is used to run the processes

I know it's not the best practice to just quote the parts of the code that I'm not using right now, but that's what I did in this case. sorry

Also, I've uploaded 25 randomly selected ply's here so that you could have a look at the data:
